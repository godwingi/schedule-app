# Scheduling App

## Description

The following app is a scheduler app that allows users to add what they are going to accomplish for their day.

This is a very good app, which will help keep you organized and manage your time wisely.

Some of the key concepts I learned from building this app was:
- how to split and parse integers
- I also learned how to call parent and child classes / IDs in order place them into an array in local storage.

## Usage

This app is very straigh-forward. It encompasses a 12-hour day from 9am to 9pm. 

In the boxes, you type out the things you will be doing, and click "save". This will then store your information onto the local storage, so that when you come back to it, you will be able to add, delete or view your current schedule of the day.
